# 🍷 Wine Quality EDA Project

## 📌 Overview

This project explores the **Wine Quality Dataset** to uncover relationships between various chemical properties and wine quality scores. Using powerful Python libraries, I performed an in-depth **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify the key factors that impact the taste and quality of red and white wines.

## 📂 Dataset

- **Source**: UCI Machine Learning Repository  
- **Attributes**: 11 physicochemical features (e.g., alcohol, pH, sulphates)  
- **Target**: Wine quality score (0–10)

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Understand data distributions using univariate analysis  
- Explore relationships between features and wine quality  
- Visualize key patterns and correlations  
- Derive actionable insights from data

## 📊 Key Insights

- **Alcohol** has a strong **positive** correlation with wine quality.
- **Volatile acidity** negatively affects the taste and quality.
- **Citric acid** and **sulphates** show moderate positive influence.
- Most wines fall into the mid-range quality category (5–6).
